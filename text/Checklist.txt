Solar PV & Solar Thermal Energy System Permit Checklist Page 1 of 5 
OVERVIEW 
The pre submittal checklist below contains the minimum information and project plan details 
required to be submitted to Blaine County when applying for a permit to install a residential and 
commercial/non residential solar photovoltaic (PV) system. The checklist is intended to support solar 
installers and customers in the solar permit application process, and is not required for submitt al.

REQUIRED PERMITS 
A building and electrical permit must be obtained prior to the start of any work. Complete the permit 
application form(s) . Blaine County provides a 12 day streamlined review process for solar PV systems . 
However, the typical 12 day turnaround time are based on best efforts and not guaranteed. 
Incomplete applications, unlicensed contractors, and insufficient information on equipment and 
systems can also delay permit turnaround. 
Check to confirm applications have been completed .

NO YES Check YES or NO to confirm completion of permit application submittal . 
- Drawings provided that show array supports, framing members, and 
foundation posts and footings. 
- Information provided on mounting structure(s) construction with ICCES 
Report verifying compliance with code requirements . 
- Detail provided that show module attachment method to mounting 
structure. 
- Solar thermal systems: the solar storage tank is placed on a slab on grade, 
or documentation shows that the floor sys tem can support the load. 
- ACKNOWLEDGEMENT 
This checklist takes into account the unused dead load that a second layer of roofing materials would 
impose upon the roof structure and allows the solar array’s gravity load to be used in place of the 
dead load allowance for the second roofing materials layer. 
When the roofing materials meet the end of the intended service life at which they were designed 
and need to be replaced, the solar array will need to be removed along with all existing roofing 
materials. Then a new roof can be installed and the solar array re installed, so as to not exceed the 
designed allowable dead load of the roof structure. 
Although this checklist takes into consideration the allowable dead loads for a Code compliant roof 
structure, Bl aine County Building Services recommends consulting with a structural engineer for all 
increases in gravity loads imposed on existing structures. 
I hereby acknowledge that I have received and reviewed the above stated policy .
